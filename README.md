Spinners
========

A collection of spinners that I made over the years for fun. I made the
collection because I was talking with two of my friends and together we
came up with the wavy guy smiley and we decided to make it into an
animation for a progress indicator.

After the first one was made, I was curious how it would like in other
languages, because the original implementation was a mixture of I/O,
sleeping and 'advanced' terminal commands like erasing previously
written characters.

This list is by far not complete, I sometimes added a language whenever
I felt like it.

I hope it will bring a laugh to someone else as well :)
